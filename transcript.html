            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">00:02</span> Welcome to the Football Association of Ireland's Grassroots
                 coach education program. This video helps you understand how to enter and progress through its Core 
                 Qualifications and stages up to and including the UEFA C license. All of our FAI coach education courses 
                 are based on the UEFA coaching convention and aligned with the FAI Player Development and are designed to 
                 promote key approaches to development and learning.

            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">00:34</span> You will need to find the right entry point into the program, 
                matching your experience and involvement. Entry point one is a starting point for most volunteer and parent 
                coaches, developing fundamentals for coaching younger players. Our BDP-1 course focuses on coaching six to 
                nine-year-olds, followed by PDP2 for ages 10-12. Coaches with experience in the 13-17 range...

            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">01:14</span> Entry point two, with the PDP3 course, builds expertise and
                 age-appropriate skills for experienced coaches. If you coach adult amateurs, entry point three with the adult 
                 amateur license may be ideal. Each path results in a Grassroots certificate, making you eligible for a Grassroots
                  coach ID card.

            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">01:52</span> - As part of the FAI's commitment to lifelong learning, your 
                certificate remains valid for a minimum of three years. That time can be extended through earning a further 15 CPD 
                credits in that three-year period. CPD credits can be accumulated by completing further workshops and courses or 
                through attending FAI coaching conferences...
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">02:26</span> - These courses can also provide valuable CPD credits for those 
                looking to maintain qualifications and enhance future higher-level coaching qualifications. Once you've achieved 
                your entry-level certificate, the FAI offers a whole range of workshops that will enhance and develop your expertise. 
                These act as a valuable source of CPD credits and are the gatekeeper to the next qualification, the national D license...
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="timestamp" tabindex="0">03:02</span> - If you want to take this step, you will need to join the FAI licensed
                 coaches club and register with the FAI coach education learning management system, opening up access to a whole host of 
                 resources, FAI sessions planning software, and opportunities to earn CPD credits online...
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="timestamp">03:40</span> With a minimum of five years coaching experience, you can advance toward the UEFA 
                Leaders Award, aligned with the FAI Club Mark program. Completing the Leaders Award leads to the UEFA C license, the 
                pinnacle qualification within the Grassroots program.
